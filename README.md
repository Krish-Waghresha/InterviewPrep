InterviewPrep: Project Story

The Beginning:
So, I had this idea to create something helpful for those prepping for tech interviews. I wanted it to cover C, Java, and OOP because, well, those are the hot topics, right?

Phase 1: Collecting the Goods
First up, I went on a quest for questions. I scoured forums, websites, you name it, and ended up with a sweet collection of 130 questions, sorted by how tough they were.

Phase 2: Figuring Out the Tech Stuff
Now, I'm no expert, but I wanted to understand how things like cookies, sessions, and JSP work. Let's just say, it was a bit of a rollercoaster ride! But hey, trial and error is how we learn, right?

Phase 3: Making It Look Good
I'm no designer either, but I wanted this thing to look snazzy. So, I tinkered with the UI, played around with CSS, and bam! InterviewPrep got a makeover.

What I Learned:

1. Got the hang of cookies and sessions, finally!
2. Figured out how to build a database without losing my mind.
3. CSS transitions? Nailed it.
4. Became a pro at juggling HTML, CSS, Java, and Postgres all at once.

What's Next:
\nVersion 2 is on the horizon! Less reliance on cookies, smarter database use, and some cool new features like easy question navigation.
